		<h1>The Benz Classes</h1>
		<p>So this will be fun. Since Mercedes started w/ cars or sedans, they come in these guise: 
			A-class - sub-compact, city car,<br> B-class - city car, but slightly bigger dimension for 
			families in mind, C-class compact car, E-Class Executive Car, <br>S-Class - Full Size Car - 
			originally called Sondler Klasse, meaning special class
			</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="classes-col">
					<h3>CL prefixed Classes</h3>
					<p>Then, they made the 4 door version of the coupe silhouette, and they give the
						 CL prefix to all the sedan classes. So right now it’s CLA-class - 4-door coupe version of the A-class sedan
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="classes-col">
					<h3>SL prefixed Classes</h3>
					<p>They also produce a roadster in their line up. A 2-door coupe w/ a
						 retractable roof. This line has a SL-prefix.
						</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">	
				<div class="classes-col">
					<h3>GL prefixed Classes</h3>
					<p>Just like how they added CL- prefix to 4-door version of the coupe, they added GL- prefix to the
						 range of SUV.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="classes-col">
					<h3>EQ prefixed Classes</h3>
					<p>In this class Electrification is the future and Mercedes is already planning to go with it. Currently, 
						pure battery electric vehicles have the EQ-class moniker.
